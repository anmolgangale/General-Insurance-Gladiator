								Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The existing insurance systems require an agent to act as a mediator between the insurance
company and the customer. This leads to extra charges of payments in terms of brokerage
and token money to the customer. There is no existing provision for tracking the status of
insurance application of the customer. The customer document verification needs to be done
by the agent by manually visiting the customer or by having the customer visit the company
centre.
LTI Insurance is a project under finance domain developed in order to remove all the existing
problems prevailing in the current insurance firms. The aim is to develop a user friendly,
secure, error free online application where the user can buy insurance policies, renew them
and claim the insurance. The user will also be able to read detailed yet easy to understand
excerpts about different insurance policies provided by the application.
This application is will be developed to cater to the needs of customers who are looking for
an easy to use and responsive web application in order to buy vehicle insurance or travel
insurance.
